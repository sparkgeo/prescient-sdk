            For example `exclude=["*.txt", "*.csv"] would skip any matched files that end with a .txt or
            .csv suffix. If not provided by default all files will be uploaded.

            a default PrescientClient instance will be created.
        overwrite (bool, optional): Whether to overwrite objects if they already exist. If False, upload
            is skipped. Useful for continuing an upload that was started previously. Defaults to True.
